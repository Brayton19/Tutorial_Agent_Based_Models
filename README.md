# Tutorial_Agent_Based_Models
A Short Tutorial on Agent Based Modeling in Python

Authors: Limor Raviv and Bill Thompson

## Summary

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks offering a short tutorial in agent-based modeling. The tutorials are written in Python. The tutorial incrementally constructs a simple simulation that reflects our theoretical interests: the cultural evolution of language through interaction in populations. We hope that the tutorials can be of some use even to those who wish to build simulations of completely different topics. 

We aim for simplicity in design: agents are represented as simple Python lists whose elements represent their properties; populations are represented as lists of agents; evolution is implemented by looping over members of the population and modifying their properties. it is our hope that these implementation principles can be applied to a broad range of phenomena.           

## Technical Requirements

You can download the whole of this tutorial by clicking the green "Clone or Download" button at the top right of this page. 

You'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) installed to run the notebooks yourself. We recommend using the [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python) distribution of Python, which should include everything you need including Jupyter. We wrote the tutorial using Python 2.7, so it's probably beter to use Python 2.7 to run the notebooks unless you understand the differences between Python versions 2.7 and 3.x.


## Notebooks
If you already know Python, jumpy straight to Part Two. 

### Part One:

[notebook here](https://github.com/Limor-Raviv/Tutorial_Agent_Based_Models/blob/master/Part%201%20-%20Python%20Basics%20for%20Agent%20Based%20Modelling.ipynb)

Part one lays out the Python basics. You'll need to be reasonably comfortable with the material in this notebook to begin building the models in the following sections. We hope that even somebody who hasn't used any programming language before could follow this notebook, but it is designed to be readble in an afternoon by someone who understands how programming works generally (e.g. can code in another language, like R or Matlab), but doesn't have much experience with  Python. 

### Part Two:
