# Tutorial_Agent_Based_Models
A Tutorial for Agent Based Models in Python


Here's where we'll describe this repository a little. I'd emphasize that the tutorial follows our interests in language and interaction, but demonstrates some simple principles of agent based modelling -- and iomplementing a model in Python in particular -- that could well be useful more broadly to anybody wishing to simulate simple populations.

We can also give a quick summary of each Part:

### Part One:

[notebook here](https://github.com/Limor-Raviv/Tutorial_Agent_Based_Models/blob/master/Part%201%20-%20Python%20Basics%20for%20Agent%20Based%20Modelling.ipynb)

Part one lays out the Python basics you'll need to be reasonably comfortable with to build the models in the following sections. We hope that even somebody who hasn;t used any programming language before could follow this notebook, but it is designed to be readble in an afternoon by someone who understands how programming works generally (e.g. can code in another language, like R or Matlab), but doesn't have much experience with  Python.
